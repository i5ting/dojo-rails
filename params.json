This gem allows you to use the full dojo suite in your [Ruby on Rails](http://github.com/rails/rails) application. The project is divided into three gems dojo-rails, [dijit-rails](https://github.com/robin850/dijit-rails) and [dojox-rails](https://github.com/robin850/dojox-rails). \r\n\r\nThis repository used to host each project's folder but there are now in their own repository. This one host dojo itself (the base and full version).\r\n\r\n**Notice** : these gems aren't very stable for the moment. You must be aware of that. \r\n\r\n## Installation and use\r\n\r\nTo use these gems, you should edit the `Gemfile` of your application and add the following line:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\ngem 'dojo-rails'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen run the `bundle` command to install it. Now, inside your javascript assets, you can use dojo? If you want more information on how to set-up and use one of these gems in your application, please see [the wiki](https://github.com/robin850/dojo-rails/wiki).\r\n\r\nNotice that `dojo-rails` provides both the base and full distribution of the toolkit. If you just the want the base distribution, in your js file, add:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//= require dojo\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd for the full version:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n//= require dojo/dojo\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! It may seem obvious but you can also use [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org) in your files. Here an example [reference guide](http://dojotoolkit.org/reference-guide/1.8/):\r\n\r\n```coffeescript\r\n#= require dojo\r\nrequire([\"dojo/router\", \"dojo/dom\", \"dojo/fx\", \"dojo/domReady!\"], (router, dom, fx) ->\r\n  router.register(\"/articles/:id\", (evt) ->\r\n    alert \"The article has the id \" + evt[id]\r\n  )\r\n  router.startup()\r\n\r\n  greeting = dom.byId(\"greeting\")\r\n  greeting.innerHTML += \" from Dojo!\"\r\n\r\n  fx.slideTo({\r\n    top: 100,\r\n    left: 200,\r\n    node: greeting\r\n  }).play()\r\n)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Troubleshooting\r\n\r\nOne of the worst problem when you use dojo-rails and Coffeescript together is that sometimes, Dojo defines functions which are reserved keyword in Coffeescript such as `then` with `dojo/request` or the `dojo/on` module that you will certainly name `on`. Except rename modules, there is no real solution such as for the `then` function. If you have a solution, **please let me know**!\r\n\r\n## Usage with Asset Pipeline in Production\r\n\r\nTo use with production and asset pipeline from Rails 3.1 you will need to have the [djConfig](http://dojotoolkit.org/documentation/tutorials/1.8/dojo_config/) hash set before you load the dojo/dojo library\r\n\r\n*This is critical for production mode because otherwise the require[ ] statements will not load libraries correctly*\r\n\r\nExample contents of application.js\r\n```coffeescript\r\n//= require dojo_config\r\n//= require dojo/dojo\r\n```\r\nContents of dojo_config.js\r\n```javascript\r\ndojoConfig = {\r\n  baseUrl: '/assets/dojo/'\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Special thanks\r\n\r\nI want to thanks the [jquery-rails](http://github.com/rails/jquery-rails) project ; it helps me to release theses three projects. I would also thanks the [Ruby on Rails team](http://github.com/rails/) and its contributors. Thanks guys!\r\n\r\n## Contribution\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute to the code of the project to enhance a gem or the full suite, thanks ! You just have to :\r\n\r\n* Fork the project\r\n* Clone the repository on your local machine\r\n* Create a new branch with `git checkout -b new_feature`\r\n* Make changes and commit them\r\n* `git push origin master`\r\n* Open a new pull request\r\n\r\n### Bugs and issues\r\n\r\nIf you found bug or if you have issues, please open a [new ticket](https://github.com/robin850/dojo-rails/issues/new) on the issue tracker.
